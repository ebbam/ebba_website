In this virtual event Ebba Mark, Moritz Schwarz, and UK Government's newly appointed Head of Mission Control for Clean Power 2030, Chris Stark discuss the policy implications from an Oxford Smith School/INET Oxford new paper published in Science.  This panel discussion goes beyond the academic analysis, asking the ‘so what’ question: what concrete, major policy changes can be made based on the findings of this paper? What does it mean, for instance, for UK policymakers seeking to close the emissions gap in their progress towards net zero, while making Britain a clean energy superpower? And how can policies be leveraged more effectively either on their own, or in combinations, by developing countries?
Join us with a special panel of speakers, including the UK Government's Head of Mission Control for Clean Power 2030 and two authors of the paper, Moritz Schwarz and Ebba Mark, to discuss what makes for successful policy mixes in a volatile world; how the emissions gap can be closed in different countries; and, what this means for policymakers facing time and resource constraints.
