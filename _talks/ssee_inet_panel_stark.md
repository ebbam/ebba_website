In this virtual event Ebba Mark, Moritz Schwarz, and UK Government's newly appointed Head of Mission Control for Clean Power 2030, Chris Stark, discuss the policy implications of an Oxford Smith School/INET Oxford paper published in *Science*, "Climate policies that achieved major emission reductions: Global evidence from two decades". This panel discussion goes beyond the academic analysis, asking the ‘so what’ question: what concrete, major policy changes can be made based on the findings of this paper? What does it mean, for instance, for UK policymakers seeking to close the emissions gap in their progress towards net zero, while making Britain a clean energy superpower? And how can policies be leveraged more effectively either on their own, or in combinations, by developing countries? What makes for successful policy mixes in a volatile world? What does this mean for policymakers facing time and resource constraints?
