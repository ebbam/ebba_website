This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

About
======
I am DPhil student with Climate Econometrics, the Institute for New Economic Thinking, and the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at the University of Oxford. I focus on applying econometric  and agent-based modelling methods to the study of what constitutes a 'Just Transition.' Passionate about evidence-based policymaking and ensuring that urgent environmental action is compatible with ongoing fights for greater equality, my research interest is in advancing empirical work to inform the scale and type of Just Transition policies necessary as societies move towards fulfilling net-zero objectives.

I am a Graduate Scholar with the Calleva Research Centre based at Magdalen College as well as a Europaeum Scholar.

Previously, I worked as Junior Policy Advisor to the OECD Chief of Staff and G20/G7 Sherpa in Paris as part of the Organisation’s Young Associate Programme. In this role, I supported the Chief of Staff in advancing her strategic agenda, including the coordination of the organisation’s gender equality, social policy, and inclusive growth work.

I hold an MSc in Environmental Change and Management from the University of Oxford and a BA in Economics from Harvard University.
